# GoGym
## Introduction

GoGym is a Gym Training web application that allows users to register, log in, and explore training classes conducted by various trainers. Users can view detailed information about trainers, check their availability, and purchase packages. Integrated with Firebase for authentication and Stripe for secure payments, GoGym provides an efficient and seamless user experience.

Additionally, users can apply to become trainers, and administrators have the authority to manage requests. GoGym features three types of dashboards: **Admin**, **Trainer**, and **Member**, each tailored for its respective user type.
